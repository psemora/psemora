# About me

+ I am a graduate of Institute of Automation and Computer Science, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering at Brno University of Technology. I am junior programmer and I am interested in machine learning (especially neural networks), computer vision and robotics. 

+ This GitHub profile contains several of my personal or team school projects and tasks. Most of them are written in python, which is my favourite programming language. I also did some simple school projects in B&R Automation Studio, LOGO! Soft Comfort, FluidSim or Simulink.
